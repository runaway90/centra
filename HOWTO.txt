Hi, i`m Bezgin V. and here are my solution for practice test for Centra company.

Give me a chance to explane my solution:

Firstly I wanted to rewrite code from the test. But when I reading this, I not understood structure of code(Some time class had function from another).
Then, I tried to understand process of logic. It was wrote better, but some things (as for my attantion) was not needed.
Then, I tried to run this THE MACHINE and not found normal documentation for libraries GitHubClient. I tried discover that, but it was difficult to understand.
Than, (firstly in my life) I read GitHubAPI v.3(It`s simple API) and understood that rewriting of the test I must will start from API.

Now solution is a simple API Client and process of building table(with Models) based on GuzzleHTTPClient with TWIG-template.
I not decide to use big frameworks(like as Symfony or Laravel) because I wanted to try rewrite code by myself.

HOW TO USE.
1. Clone repo from git.
2. Install packages from composer and check user/group permissions.
3. Configure local virtual host with Apache or NGINX(with route to ..../centra/public/index.php) and add this host name to local host list( /etc/hosts).
4. In file index.php, You need to add CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REPOSITORY_NAME, OWNER. (I wrote test data, You can change it).
5. Open name of local host site in browser.

FOR 'MANUAL' TEST with command line: run command 'php public/php.php' and take response with all information about repository with REPOSITORY_NAME.

To do :
1.Deploy.
2.Add possible to authorization with token.
3.Create page with input CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REPOSITORY_NAME, OWNER and validation of it.
